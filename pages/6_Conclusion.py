This project successfully demonstrated the implementation and practical application of **CFB (Cipher Feedback) mode**, 
one of the fundamental block cipher modes of operation in modern cryptography.

Through both theoretical analysis and hands-on implementation, we have explored how CFB mode transforms 
block ciphers into stream ciphers, enabling secure encryption of variable-length data streams.

st.markdown("""
#### **1. CFB Mode Characteristics**
- **Stream-like behavior**: CFB converts block ciphers into stream ciphers, allowing encryption of data of any length
- **Self-synchronizing**: The mode can recover from transmission errors automatically
- **Error propagation**: Limited error propagation enhances security but requires careful handling

#### **2. Implementation Insights**  
- **Symmetric operations**: Both encryption and decryption use the block cipher's encryption function
- **Feedback mechanism**: The feedback register creates dependency between blocks, enhancing security
- **Segment flexibility**: Variable segment sizes allow optimization for different use cases

#### **3. Security Considerations**
- **IV uniqueness**: Critical requirement - never reuse IVs with the same key
- **Key management**: Proper key generation and storage are essential
- **Authentication**: CFB provides confidentiality but not authenticity - combine with HMAC for production use

#### **4. Practical Applications**
- **Real-time communications**: Perfect for encrypting data streams as they arrive
- **Network protocols**: Used in SSL/TLS and other secure communication protocols  
- **Error-prone channels**: Self-synchronizing property makes it suitable for noisy communication channels
