The main objectives of this CFB (Cipher Feedback) mode implementation project are:

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objectives:

1. **Understand CFB Mode Theory**: Learn the mathematical foundation and working principle of CFB mode operation.

2. **Implement CFB Encryption Algorithm**: Build a complete CFB encryption system that can handle variable-length input data.

3. **Implement CFB Decryption Algorithm**: Develop the corresponding decryption process to recover original plaintext.

4. **Demonstrate Stream Cipher Behavior**: Show how CFB transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher.

5. **Interactive Simulation**: Create a user-friendly interface for encrypting/decrypting text and understanding the process.
